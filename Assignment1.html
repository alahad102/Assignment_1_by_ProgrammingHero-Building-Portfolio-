            <h3>Undergrad Thesis | Targeted Face Recognition from Video and Alarm
                Generation for Security Concern</h3>
            <p> Face recognition has been considered one of the most
                important means of security in prevention of crimes in this era.
                Implementation of face recognition has led to reduction in crime
                rates in major cities around the world. Surveillance cameras
                in crowded areas keeps good monitoring of all activities. So
                it can be used as a witness against criminals or can be used
                to prevent crime before happening. With the advancement and
                research in deep neural networks in surveillance cameras, face
                recognition accuracy has increased in challenging environments
                too. But our country is still lagging behind in this regard. By
                making a security system that can recognize the face of a person
                wanted by the law enforcement authority, positive steps are taken
                towards the benefit of the society. So the proposed work focuses
                mainly on face recognition with custom Bangladeshi dataset
                that can be robust enough against blurriness, pose variations
                and occlusions. Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) model was
                chosen since it produced significant improvement in accuracy
                compared to many state of the art models. Tensorflow API was
                used with SSD Mobilenet FPN model config to generate alarms
                when targeted face was recognized among many faces in crowd.</p>
